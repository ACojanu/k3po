[build-status-image]: https://travis-ci.org/k3po/specification.tcp.svg?branch=develop
[build-status]: https://travis-ci.org/k3po/specification.tcp

This project uses [K3PO](http://github.com/k3po/k3po) to help TCP Protocol 
([RFC-793](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793) implementations automate their verification of the necessary specification requirements.

Note: all testing of the TCP protocol is done above what is provided by the OS/Java stack, thus the semantics of tcp protocol are currently not tested in this project
