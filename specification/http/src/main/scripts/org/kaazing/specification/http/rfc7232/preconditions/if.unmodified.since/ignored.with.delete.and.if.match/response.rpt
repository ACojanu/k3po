# Since If-Match header is specified, If-Unmodified-Since header must be ignored according
# to RFC 7232. Also, the entity-tag of the selected resource representation matches the etag
# that is specified using If-Match. This means that the condition is true/satisfied. So, the
# requested method should be performed. And the response should include 204(No Content)
# success status code.
