# Since If-None-Match header is specified, If-Modified-Since header must be ignored according
# to RFC 7232. Since the entity-tag of the selected resource representation matches the etag
# that is specified using If-None-Match and there by failing the condition, the requested GET
# method should not be performed. Instead, the response should include 304(Not Modified) status.
